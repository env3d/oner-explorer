	Imagine you are working as a new bank officer.  Your job is to approve loans,
	but you don't want to make any mistakes, so you decided to look at some historical data:

      <div class='row'>
	Can we use this to determine who to approve if someone comes in our door?
      </div>

      <div class='row'>
	"Eyeballing" the data may give us an idea, but let's take a more systemic approach.
      </div>
      
      <div class='row'>
	To start, our end goal is to predict if we want to approve someone when they
	walk into our office, and we only want to base our approval decision on just ONE of their
	attribute.  We need to determine which attribute is most influential.

	So we simply look at one attribute at a time.  Let's start with the 'Gender' attribute.
      </div>

      <pre class='row'>

Gender Approved       
Female No            3
       Yes          12
Male   No           10
       Yes           1

      </pre>

      <div class='row'>
	I have counted all the "Gender - Approval" combinations.  It seems like when someone is a female,
	they are more likely to be approved (12 cases approved, 3 cases reject).

	If someone is male, they are most likely rejected (10 cases reject, 1 case approve).

	We can use this to create the following rules:  If female, approved.  If male, reject.
	
	This set of rules would have be accurate for 22 cases out of a total of 26 cases, or 84.62%
      </div>

      <div class='row'>
	Let's do the same for the other columns:  "Income" and "Martial Status"
      </div>

      <pre class='row'>
	
Income Approved       
HIGH   No            7
       Yes           6
LOW    No            6
       Yes           7

      </pre>

      <pre class='row'>

Martial Status Approved       
Married        No            4
               Yes           6
Single         No            9
               Yes           7

      </pre>

      If female, approve.  If male, reject. 84.62% accuracy.

      High income reject, low income approve. 53.85% accuracy.

      Married approved, single reject. 57.69% accuracy.
